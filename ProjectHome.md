## Introduction ##

Log4net is really a wonderful tool library for developers, and I have gotten lots of benifit from it for serveral developing projects. Since it provides flexiable, powerful log mechanism, it also provides a complex and unfriendly configuration way in XML. It's not easy to push those junior developers to lever this library well, and the learning curve is too cliffy to know all features of it in a short time. I can't find any GUI tool to assist config log4net as WinCVS does for CVS, so I write a simple one for my company. Insteading of releasing an executive file directly, I release it as DLL library. It makes possible to integrate/merge/embed this GUI tool in your project or product, and make usage extensively. You may see how I integrate it into MMC (Microsoft Management Console) at the above picture.
